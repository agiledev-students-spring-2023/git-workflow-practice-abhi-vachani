Link to Article "The Friendship That Made Google Huge: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge

One thing that I found particularly interesting is how Sanjay and Jeff actually looked at the Binary Code as a way to debug. To me, that is insane because imagine how tedious that would be? Already debugging with an editor is very painful, but I'm still processing how they looked at every 0 and 1 in the Binary representation of the code and were able to solve it. 

Another thing to note is the lack of recognition for Sanjay and Jeff. While most people know of Google's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the truth is Google would not be anywhere near what it is today if Sanjay and Jeff hadn't been able to fix this huge bug that Google had. 

##Comment from Chenyi Xu:
I found this article interesting in the sense that the story highlights some of the 
personalities and features that are valued in a professional business relationship, such 
as entrepreneurial spirit and analytical skills. This reminded me of another article that 
I came across on the internet: [How to Choose Software Development 
Partner](https://tasmaniantimes.com/2023/02/how-to-choose-software-development-partner/). 
I think these aspects should also be considered in our project-making process.
